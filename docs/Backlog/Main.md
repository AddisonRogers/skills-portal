- Add AI tutor
- Add AI generate roadmaps probably
- Fix skills probably and make it so it's xp / role / pathway rather than individual skills

## Thinking on skills

ai-agents, frontend, backend, c# // works and valid but
tailwind, specific tools to mark on arent.
Now could make it so it's opt in on the admin portal ie deciding to measure html but not css etc

this would mean that to do this I would add a new column in the skills table to decide if it's viewable etc
