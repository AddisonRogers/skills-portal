## Notes he sent me 

What am i looking for as a leader
- People to progress, people to learn, people to be happy!
- Skills that are relevant in the current and future markets
- Skills and certifications i can sell, the more i can sell, the more i can ££ reward

My thoughts on the structure
- As well as role and skill, do we include capability? some people might want to switch roles or try something new, internally
- Can the learning paths be structured to the need, e.g: "understanding cloud engineering" or "How to be an effective team leader"

Managing skills and progress
- your current skill level and experience (Tony's SM)
- What are the top %role% skills for 2026 and beyond - plus AI insights it to what's used, what's trending, what's paying more month by month
- your target career path (management, tech, sales, architecture, etc)
- your selected skills path (which you can change)

 Journeys
- Gamification - love it. It has to be engaging and people need to see they're making progress.
- I'd be inclined to break up the journeys and you develop throughout, but you learn a little of all relevant areas to shape the role, so you would have something like:
	- "How to be an AI developer"
	- Foundation
	- Intermediate 
	- Advanced

- include softer skills for each role
- include paths for certification or preparing for certification
- include items that may not be tech based but are part of the role, e.g "preparing to gather requirements from customers.."
- How many hours will this take to complete? What is the expected skills level (foundation [no skills needed], inter [some idea], advanced [much knowledge or good understanding, or completion of previous modules). 

Extras
- Sandbox environments
- AI insights as you go through..."50% of people are currently learning XXX.."

Rewards
- printouts, internal certs or well dones
- links to bamboo or culture amp to show progress on objectives
- links to linkedin and beyond for success
