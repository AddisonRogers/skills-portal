Google, Find a course, MSLearn, Pluralsight (much prefer video courses), chatgpt + yt for quick solutions. Small problem chatgpt. 

FSP has only given me (addison) as a teacher / buddy to help and assist and guide my learning + point of check in. Nothing else, guidance to look at azure fundamentals + pluralsight and msdocs. Mentorship program was useful but has not continued it. 

Multiverse, bootcamp was helpful to get a initial start in a short amount of time. He thinks they are understanding that you wont remember everything. They challenge you but reassure you. Good environment. The projects they give were beneficial but not directly supporting fsp's toolkit. Outside of the bootcamp: not very useful. Felt like work taught you the concept through client work and multiverse is there to just dumb it down / go over it again. 

somewhat knows what to do next but generally unsure and wants guidance. Wants guidance with frontend dev but not sure where to start / go from. AI same thing.

Gamified is very useful and wants it. Best way to encourage is to gamify it as possible. Milestones. Rewards. Badges. 

Wants this to affect clients + roles + pay but also wants his own voice heard. Wants a toggle to express interest in client work in a particular thing. 

Doesnt feel under utilised
Doesnt feel like a very clear path (without me)
Biggest blockers going onto client work was the fear of importance
Biggest thing stopping him from learning stuff is that it's so big and large and he gets overwhelmed + many libraries
Forgets about resources + Not directly applicable + Wants to explore things himself
Stuff he hears talked about and wants to directly find it
Wants it to be encouraged by team leads + set goals through it + progress reviews
Rewards !!
