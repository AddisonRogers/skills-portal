started at fsp on his 4th year of uni - studied programming, hardware and things like that. Done lots of C++. Started Java for some work aswell. Also done some software engineering ie create schema of a database type shit. Some experience with AI aswell at uni. LocalSearch? Old AI. 

first two weeks at fsp was just reading documentation on efcore, c#, taught some bicep ie pointed to videos, documentation and gave a project. 

First thing was proof of concept for oxford economics. React app. Didn't really know react / frontend. Most of the things he was doing was doing minor html changes due to the library. 

Biggest issue he found going from uni-work was communication + handling a client. Insecurity. Some of the bugs in company projects were very different than to uni projects.

Tiktok recommendations, google, person recommendations
not sure what to learn next kinda lost. No learning path !!
Doesnt care about dumb games. I should consider most the people just at fsp for a j-o-b.
Most of people in the UK didnt care about the hackathon and only the juniors cared. 

"Give me the path and ill do it idc about you" would like this linked to company goals and money / role progression. More responsibilities not sure where to start / get there

 Feels under utilised - more about the projects we currently have than the skills. Ie he is more of a backend guy (c++) 

thinks other people will like gamification. he has a old mentality thinks he is a 40 y/o guy lmao.
